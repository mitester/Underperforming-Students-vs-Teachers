## Code Conventions
- **DO NOT** write function definitions in header files, since the complier will not check mistakes.
- Use ***Camel Case*** to name functions and variables.
- All decimal variables should be stored in `double` type.
- Please use `/* I am some detailed description */` to describe the class at the top of the header files
- Please write comment `//i am a very readable comment` (such that other people can understand your code).
- Use **MIL (Member Initialization List)** in class constructors.

## Workflow
1. All tasks are listed in `issue` section.
2. Take tasks in `issue` by yourself.
3. Feel free to add issues to `issue`.
4. Create your own `branch` to commit your work. Name your branch as `[your github username]-patch`.
5. After everything is finished, we merge branches together.
