## Code Conventions
- **DO NOT** write function definitions in header files, since the complier will not check mistakes.
- Use ***Camel Case*** to name functions and variables.
- All decimal variables should be stored in `double` type.
- Please write comment `//i am a very readable comment` (such that other people can understand your code).
- Always remember to write documentation.
- Use **MIL (Member Initialization List)** in class constructors

## Workflow
1. All tasks are listed in `issue` section.
2. Take tasks in `issue` by yourself.
3. Feel free to add issues to `issue`.
4. Create your own `branch` to commit your work.
5. After everything is finished, we merge branches together.
